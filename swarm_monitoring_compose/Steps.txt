step-1 -> Create docker compose file as I have created swarm_compose.yml

Step-2 -> Initiate docker swarm on manager node and join worker node via token

	docker swarm init --advertise-addr 35.154.12.229
	docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-3ysulo21e4xyg7pva46kihfeb00sn3mjtqlwq9ln6e422c1n7t-2ne1zcbp8phpwqjd3162tkhdi 13.233.29.111:2377
	- To check node is succesfully joined to manager or leader: 
		docker node ls

Step-3 -> Create Service from the docker compose file to run on each node using swarm stack
	docker stack deploy -c swarm_compose.yml goal-server

Step-4 -> You can check service list or process
	- docker service ls
	- docker ps

Now service is created on each node successfully..
